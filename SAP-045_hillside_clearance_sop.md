# Standard Operating Procedure SAP-045: Hillside Clearance in Wooded Terrain

**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Revision:** 1.0
**Prepared by:** [Name/Team]
**Approved by:** [Safety Officer]

## 1. Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes safe and systematic methods for clearing mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) from densely wooded hillsides where manual clearance is the only viable option. The procedure addresses the specific risks posed by steep gradients, loose soil from recent rainfall, and high landslide potential in the Sapna area.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in hillside clearance operations within the designated wooded terrain of Sapna. It covers planning, risk assessment, personnel requirements, equipment checks, clearance techniques, and emergency response.

## 3. Risk Assessment
### 3.1. Identified Hazards
- **Steep Slope:** Increased risk of slips, falls, and loss of balance.
- **Loose Soil:** Reduced stability, potential for soil movement and mine displacement.
- **Landslide Potential:** Sudden soil movement could displace mines and create new hazardous areas.
- **Dense Wooded Terrain:** Limited visibility, obstacles, and difficulty in maneuvering.
- **Weather Conditions:** Recent rainfall exacerbates soil instability and reduces traction.
- **Manual Clearance Constraints:** Limited ability to use heavy machinery; reliance on manual methods increases exposure time.

### 3.2. Risk Mitigation Measures
- **Terrain Evaluation:** Conduct a pre‑clearance site survey to identify the steepest sections, soil composition, and signs of recent erosion.
- **Weather Monitoring:** Operations shall be suspended if rainfall exceeds 10 mm in 24 hours or if soil saturation is deemed high.
- **Slope Stabilization:** Where possible, install temporary retaining nets or wooden stakes to reduce soil movement.
- **Work in Pairs:** No personnel shall work alone; a buddy system is mandatory.
- **Regular Communication:** Maintain radio contact with the base camp every 30 minutes.

## 4. Personnel Requirements
### 4.1. Team Composition
- **Team Leader (1):** Certified de‑mining supervisor with at least 5 years of experience in manual clearance.
- **Clearance Operators (2–4):** Trained and accredited for manual mine detection and disposal.
- **Safety Officer (1):** Responsible for monitoring compliance with this SOP and initiating emergency procedures.
- **Medic (1):** On‑site with a fully stocked trauma kit and evacuation capability.

### 4.2. Training and Certification
- All personnel must have completed a recognized hillside‑clearance training module within the last 12 months.
- Refresher training on emergency evacuation and landslide response is required before deployment.

## 5. Equipment Check
### 5.1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- **Helmet** with chin strap
- **Ballistic visor** or face shield
- **Ballistic vest** (Level IV)
- **Protective trousers and jacket**
- **Steel‑toed boots** with ankle support and non‑slip soles
- **Gloves** (cut‑resistant)

### 5.2. Clearance Equipment
- **Manual Probes** (non‑sparking)
- **Metal Detectors** (calibrated for mountainous terrain)
- **Marking Kits** (flags, stakes, warning tape)
- **Hand Tools** (shovels, rakes, pickaxes)
- **Demolition Kit** (for controlled detonation on site)

### 5.3. Communication and Navigation
- **VHF Radios** (water‑resistant) with spare batteries
- **GPS Devices** with pre‑loaded maps of the clearance area
- **Whistles** and **signal mirrors** for emergency communication

### 5.4. Emergency Equipment
- **First‑Aid Kit** (including tourniquets, chest seals, hemostatic gauze)
- **Stretcher** and **splints**
- **Emergency Shelter** (lightweight tent)
- **Food and Water** for 24 hours per person

## 6. Clearance Techniques
### 6.1. Pre‑Clearance Preparation
- **Define Clearance Lane:** Mark a lane width of 1.5 m using warning tape. Lanes shall run perpendicular to the slope contour to minimize soil disturbance.
- **Establish Safe Paths:** Identify and mark primary and secondary access/egress routes that avoid the steepest sections.

### 6.2. Probing Procedure
- **Angle of Probe:** Insert probe at an angle not exceeding 30° from vertical to avoid driving the probe under a mine.
- **Depth:** Probe to a depth of 20 cm in a systematic grid pattern (10 cm intervals).
- **Pressure:** Apply gentle, consistent pressure; if resistance is felt, stop immediately and mark the location.

### 6.3. Visual Search
- **Clearing Vegetation:** Remove underbrush and low‑hanging branches carefully with hand tools. Do not use powered equipment.
- **Surface Inspection:** After probing, visually inspect the exposed soil for tripwires, pressure plates, or disturbed earth.

### 6.4. Marking and Recording
- **Confirmed Hazard:** Place a red flag/stake at the exact location. Record GPS coordinates and photograph the hazard.
- **Cleared Area:** Mark with green tape and log the coordinates in the clearance database.

## 7. Emergency Evacuation Plan
### 7.1. Triggers for Evacuation
- **Landslide observed or imminent**
- **Discovery of a mine in an unstable position**
- **Severe weather warning**
- **Medical emergency** (injury or illness)

### 7.2. Evacuation Routes
- **Primary Route:** The pre‑defined, safest path to the designated assembly point at the base of the hill (Grid Reference: [insert coordinates]).
- **Secondary Route:** An alternative path to a higher‑ground rendezvous point (Grid Reference: [insert coordinates]) if the primary route is blocked.

### 7.3. Assembly Points
- **Primary Assembly Point:** At the base camp (marked on map).
- **Secondary Assembly Point:** At the ridge top (marked on map). Use this if the base camp is inaccessible.

### 7.4. Communication During Evacuation
- **Radio Call Sign:** “EVAC‑EVAC‑EVAC” repeated three times.
- **All personnel must acknowledge receipt of the evacuation order.**
- **Team Leader will conduct a head‑count at the assembly point.**

### 7.5. Post‑Evacuation Actions
- **Do not re‑enter the clearance area until a safety assessment has been completed.**
- **Document the reason for evacuation and any changes in the hazard map.**

## 8. Documentation and Reporting
- **Daily Clearance Log:** Record weather, personnel, equipment status, hazards found, and meters cleared.
- **Incident Report:** Any near‑miss, injury, or unexpected event must be reported within 2 hours.
- **SOP Review:** This procedure shall be reviewed after each major operation and updated as needed.
